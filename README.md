## Community ❤️

REDAXO is mainly used in German-speaking countries. However, the software already comes in several languages — English, Spanish, Italian, Swedisch, Portuguese — and the community is working on translating more and more content. If you don't understand German, please don't let that stop you from trying REDAXO: The community is known for being extremely helpful and friendly, and we will support you wherever we can! ✌️

__Get to know REDAXO and its community:__

### 1. Install CMS and check out the demo websites

This is probably the best way to get to know REDAXO: install the [latest release](https://github.com/redaxo/redaxo/releases), log in to the admin section and use the built-in _Installer_ addOn to check out one of the demo websites. If you’re new to REDAXO or don’t speak german, search for `demo_base` (»Basisdemo«) as it is fully translated into English and explains all major topics.

Current demo websites: [Base](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/demo_base), [Community](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/demo_community), [OnePage](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/demo_onepage), [FullPage](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/demo_fullpage).

### 2. Join our Slack

You’ll find a lot of community members in the Slack chat. And also the core developers. This is probably the best option to ask questions and get to know the community.
