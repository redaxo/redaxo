## Community ‚ù§Ô∏è

REDAXO is mainly used in German-speaking countries. However, the software already comes in several languages ‚Äî English, Spanish, Italian, Swedisch, Portuguese ‚Äî and the community is working on translating more and more content. If you don't understand German, please don't let that stop you from trying REDAXO: The community is known for being extremely helpful and friendly, and we will support you wherever we can! ‚úåÔ∏è

__Get to know REDAXO and its community:__

### 1. Install CMS and check out the demo websites

This is probably the best way to get to know REDAXO: install the [latest release](https://github.com/redaxo/redaxo/releases), log in to the admin section and use the built-in _Installer_ addOn to check out one of the demo websites. If you‚Äôre new to REDAXO or don‚Äôt speak german, search for `demo_base` (¬ªBasisdemo¬´) as it is fully translated into English and explains all major topics.

Current demo websites: [Base](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/demo_base), [Community](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/demo_community), [OnePage](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/demo_onepage), [FullPage](https://github.com/FriendsOfREDAXO/demo_fullpage).
