# Meta info add-On

With the meta info add-on the meta fields for articles, categories, media and languages can be created and designed.

Meta fields are intended to manage page or media specific information, such as search engine keywords, an individual header image, whether it should be considered as a news teaser, whether it should appear in certain navigations, copyright info for certain photos, etc.

Fields can be defined for articles, categories as well as media. 
Available field types are `text`, `textarea`, `select`, `radio`, `checkbox` and more.
