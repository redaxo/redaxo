# Mediapool

The mediapool provides the functionality to manage media files such as images, documents and videos. The media can be organized via categories. The media pool is opened in a separate window after clicking on the link Media pool.

In the media pool, the media that have been uploaded to the server via the upload or synchronisation function are listed and can be edited. To make the sorting clearer, you may define categories and assign the loaded media to these categories.

All media managed in the media pool are located in the `/media` folder of the REDAXO installation.
