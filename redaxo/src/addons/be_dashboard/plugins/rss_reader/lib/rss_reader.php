/**
 * There are two ways that you can create a new rssReader object. The first
 * is by passing a feed URL as a parameter to the constructor
 * (as well as optionally setting the cache location and cache expiry). This
 * will initialise the whole feed with all of the default settings, and you
 * can begin accessing methods and properties immediately.
 *
 * The second way is to create the rssReader object with no parameters
 * at all. This will enable you to set configuration options. After setting
 * them, you must initialise the feed using $feed->init(). At that point the
 * object's methods and properties will be available to you. This format is
 * what is used throughout this documentation.
 *
 * @param string $feed_url This is the URL you want to parse.
 * @param string $cache_location This is where you want the cache to be stored.
 * @param int $cache_duration This is the number of seconds that you want to store the cache file for.
