# Getting Started

---

## Quick start

Bootstrap-select requires jQuery v1.9.1+, Bootstrapâ€™s dropdown.js component, and Bootstrap's CSS. If you're not already using Bootstrap in your project, a precompiled version of the Bootstrap v3.4.1 minimum requirements can be downloaded [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/?id=7830063837006f6fc84f). If using bootstrap-select with Bootstrap v4+, you'll also need Popper.js. For all of Bootstrap v4's requirements, see [Getting started](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/). A precompiled version of the requirements will be made available in an upcoming release of bootstrap-select.

Several quick start options are available:

# Usage

---
<div class="card border-warning">
	<div class="card-body">
		Bootstrap 4 only works with bootstrap-select v1.13.0+. By default, bootstrap-select automatically detects the version of Bootstrap being used. However, there are some instances where the version detection won't work. See the [documentation](https://developer.snapappointments.com/bootstrap-select/options/#bootstrap-version) for more information.
	</div>
</div>

### Via `selectpicker` class
Add the `selectpicker` class to your select elements to auto-initialize bootstrap-select.
```html
<select class="selectpicker">
  <option>Mustard</option>
  <option>Ketchup</option>
  <option>Barbecue</option>
</select>
```

### Via JavaScript
```js
// To style only selects with the my-select class
$('.my-select').selectpicker();
```
or
```js
// To style all selects
$('select').selectpicker();
```

If calling bootstrap-select via JavaScript, you will need to wrap your code in a [`.ready()`](https://api.jquery.com/ready/) block or place it at the bottom of the page (after the last instance of bootstrap-select).

```js
$(function () {
	$('select').selectpicker();
});
```
